# VowelFormantSynthesiser

The first three formant frequency values of eight vowel sounds are each fed through a resonant bandpass filter, in a parralel setup.

The formant frequency values were informed by a [benchmark dataset.](https://asa.scitation.org/doi/10.1121/1.1906875)

# FUTURE WORK
Stay tuned for further details regarding the synthesiser, and how it may be elaborated upon.
