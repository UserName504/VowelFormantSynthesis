# VowelFormantSynthesiser

The first three formant frequency values of eight vowel sounds are each fed through a resonant bandpass filter, in a parralel setup.

The formant frequency values were informed by a [benchmark dataset.](https://asa.scitation.org/doi/10.1121/1.1906875)

The renowned [Liljencrants-Fant](http://www.glottopedia.org/index.php/Liljencrants-Fant_model) model serves as the voice source waveform.

# IMPORTANT!
Ensure that the 'LF_deriv.wav' is in the same folder as the Max project file when running. More detailed instructions can be found within the patch itself.

I would recommend cloning the repository, Refer to [this page](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Getting-a-Git-Repository) for more information.

# FUTURE WORK
Stay tuned for further details regarding the synthesiser, and how it may be elaborated upon.
